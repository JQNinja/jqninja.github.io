HW Hackathon 2015 - proof of concept.

We were attempting to create an interactive info graphic so that users could get the information in tiny chunks - at their own pace with minimal technical know how. This uses only a mouse wheel or the down arrow key to navigate through the information. 

This makes use of Green Sock Animation Platform (GSAP), Scroll Magic (a plugin for GSAP), and jQuery (the greatest web framework ever) .
